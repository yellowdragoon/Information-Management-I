XML Document + DLD for the ShoppingCart Class from the UML Class Diagram.
The purpose of this document is to transform the ShoppingCart Class into the XML format, modelling its association
to the Customer Class, as well as the objects/items contained within it, namely the items list.
We also create a few ShoppingCarts to give examples.
-->

<!--
DTD for ShoppingCart.xml.
All of our ShoppingCart instances are contained within our shoppingCarts root node.
ShoppingCart has a cardinality of * since we can have no ShoppingCarts at any moment in time up to many ShoppingCarts,
i.e. if there are no Customers on our System, then there will be no Carts.
Each ShoppingCart must have exactly 1 totalCost, and exactly one ownedBy since only 1 Customer can have access to a Cart.
A Cart can have 0 or more ShoppingCart.items (*), since we are translating from a List attribute from our UML Diagram.
Each item is either a LegoSet or a LegoBrick, and the reason for the zero or one cardinality (?) is because our representation
models each item in the Cart as a seperate ShoppingCart.items entity, with each entity representing one and only one item.
LegoSets and LegoBricks must have an idref attribute to uniquely identify that Product (its superclass). 
We use ownedBy to identify the unique Customer who owns this Cart. It contains one and only one Customer element which 
must have an idref attribute, identifying that Customer. This creates the robust link between this .xml doc and the Customer.xml doc.
Allows for smooth cross-document XQueries.
